// Deterministic, explainable rule-based logic connecting real weather data
// with disease/plant characteristics. Deliberately NOT an LLM call -- every
// alert here must be traceable to a specific rule (condition -> reason ->
// recommendation), and the code must be able to say "insufficient
// information" rather than fabricate a claim.
//
// This is intentionally a small, honest ruleset. It does not claim
// scientific/agronomic authority; each result carries the explanation so a
// user (or agronomist) can judge it, not just the alert.
